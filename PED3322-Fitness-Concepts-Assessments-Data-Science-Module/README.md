# PED3322-Fitness-Concepts-Assessments-Data-Science-Module
This is a repository containing the material regarding data science modules implemented as a part of Winston-Salem State University's [Center for Applied Data Science (CADS)](https://www.wssu.edu/academics/colleges-and-departments/college-of-arts-sciences-business-education/center-for-applied-data-science/index.html) Faculty Adopter program. The Faculty Adopter Program is designed to support enthusiastic faculty who are willing to infuse data science into their courses across various disciplines and are capable of quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the impact of their interventions. 

# Fitness Concepts/Assessments
This respository contains the data science infusion adopter modules of a course in Fitness Concepts/Assessments as taught by Dr. Tan Zhang. The Fitness Concepts/Assessments course is offered in the Department of Health, PE and Sport Studies once a year at Winston-Salem State University. The students who typically enroll in this course are Physical Education majors (Both Teaching Certification and Youth Development Tracks).

The focus of this course involves preparing physical educators in creating a health-related physical education program with the goal of promoting lifelong activity and fitness. The course provides an applied approach fitness assessment, including assessing fitness levels, determining fitness goals and designing fitness programs. Lastly, knowledge of general considerations for test selection, construction, and evaluation will also be covered.

# Learning Outcomes
* Students will design and identify various measurements or tests to promote effective learning in physical education and health-enhancing fitness  
* Students will learn to make evidence-based practices in teaching fitness, fitness knowledge, and sport skills. 
* Students will learn to use a variety of assessment techniques to evaluate students and monitor their growth in the health, cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains. 
* Students will design cognitive assessments that align with national, state, and/or district standards and conduct item analysis for the cognitive assessments. 
* Students will learn to implement FitnessGram (cardiovascular, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility and body composition) with fidelity  
* Students will define the core concepts of measurement and evaluation (validity, reliability, difficulty index, discrimination index, formative and summative assessment; formal and informal assessment, norm-referenced standards, and criterion-referenced standards; constructs). 

# Data Science Infusion
The primary focus of this reposity concerns only the portion of the course where the data science infusion modules were implemented as part of the CADS adopter program. The areas covered by the data science infused modules are:
* Descriptive Analysis
* Comparison Analysis
* Correlation Analysis
