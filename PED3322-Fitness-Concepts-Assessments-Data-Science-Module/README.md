# PED3322-Fitness-Concepts-Assessments-Data-Science-Module
This is a repository containing the material regarding data science modules implemented as a part of Winston-Salem State University's [Center for Applied Data Science (CADS)](https://www.wssu.edu/academics/colleges-and-departments/college-of-arts-sciences-business-education/center-for-applied-data-science/index.html) Faculty Adopter program. The Faculty Adopter Program is designed to support enthusiastic faculty who are willing to infuse data science into their courses across various disciplines and are capable of quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the impact of their interventions. 

# Fitness Concepts/Assessments
This respository contains the data science infusion adopter modules of a course in Fitness Concepts/Assessments as taught by Dr. Tan Zhang. The Fitness Concepts/Assessments course is offered in the Department of Health, PE and Sport Studies once a year at Winston-Salem State University. The students who typically enroll in this course are Physical Education majors (Both Teaching Certification and Youth Development Tracks).

The focus of this course involves preparing physical educators in creating a health-related physical education program with the goal of promoting lifelong activity and fitness. The course provides an applied approach fitness assessment, including assessing fitness levels, determining fitness goals and designing fitness programs. Lastly, knowledge of general considerations for test selection, construction, and evaluation will also be covered.
