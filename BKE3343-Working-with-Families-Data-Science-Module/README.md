# BKE3343-Working-with-Families-Data-Science-Module
This is a repository containing the material regarding data science modules implemented as a part of Winston-Salem State University's [Center for Applied Data Science (CADS)](https://www.wssu.edu/academics/colleges-and-departments/college-of-arts-sciences-business-education/center-for-applied-data-science/index.html) Faculty Adopter program. The Faculty Adopter Program is designed to support enthusiastic faculty who are willing to infuse data science into their courses across various disciplines and are capable of quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the impact of their interventions. 
# Working with Families/Teaming with Systems
This respository contains the data science infusion adopter modules of a course in Working with Families/Teaming with Systems as taught by Dr. Natasha Spellman. The Working with Families/Teaming with Systems course is offered in the Education department once a year in the Spring at Winston-Salem State University. This course is primarily intended for education majors, specifically the major of Birth-Kindergarten Education, as well as those who have an interest in teaching/childhood education.

This module will help the student to become more scientifically literate as they learn how to perform data and statistical analysis.
# Learning Outcomes
* Students will be introduced to basic data science and analytics.
* Students will become familiar with descriptive statistics to help identify factors that impact family relationships, social-emotional development, and school success in young children.
* Students will gain hands-on experience by working with various datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Dept. of Education, and the NC Dept. of Public Instruction.

# Data Science Infusion
The primary focus of this repository concerns only the portion of the course where the data science infusion modules were implemented as part of the CADS adopter program. In this case, the module was centered around introducing students to data science by viewing and analyzing data related to families, children, and school performance.
