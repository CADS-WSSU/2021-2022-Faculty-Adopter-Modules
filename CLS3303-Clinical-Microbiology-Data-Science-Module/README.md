# CLS3303-Clinical-Microbiology-Data-Science-Module
This is a repository containing the material regarding data science modules implemented as a part of Winston-Salem State University's [Center for Applied Data Science (CADS)](https://www.wssu.edu/academics/colleges-and-departments/college-of-arts-sciences-business-education/center-for-applied-data-science/index.html) Faculty Adopter program. The Faculty Adopter Program is designed to support enthusiastic faculty who are willing to infuse data science into their courses across various disciplines and are capable of quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the impact of their interventions. 
# Clinical Microbiology
This respository contains the data science infusion adopter modules of a course in Clinical Microbiology as taught by Dr. Lisa Maness. The Clinical Microbiology course is offered in the Clinical Laboratory Science department once a year in the Fall at Winston-Salem State University. This course is primarily intended for clinical laboratory science majors or those who have an interest in clinical science or biology.

This module will help the student to become more scientifically literate as they learn how to perform data and statistical analysis.
# Learning Outcomes
* Students will acquire a basic understanding of data analytics.
* Students will become familiar with regression analysis and data-driven decision making.
* Students will gain hands-on experience in using common data science tools and techniques.

# Data Science Infusion
The primary focus of this repository concerns only the portion of the course where the data science infusion modules were implemented as part of the CADS adopter program. In this case, the module was centered around teaching regression analysis culminating in the students using those skills to analyze a COVID-19 dataset as their primary project for the module.
