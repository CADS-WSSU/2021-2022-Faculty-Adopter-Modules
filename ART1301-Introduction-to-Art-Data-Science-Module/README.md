# ART1301-Introduction-to-Art-Data-Science-Module
This is a repository containing the material regarding data science modules implemented as a part of Winston-Salem State University's [Center for Applied Data Science (CADS)](https://www.wssu.edu/academics/colleges-and-departments/college-of-arts-sciences-business-education/center-for-applied-data-science/index.html) Faculty Adopter program. The Faculty Adopter Program is designed to support enthusiastic faculty who are willing to infuse data science into their courses across various disciplines and are capable of quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the impact of their interventions. 
# Introduction to Art
This respository contains the data science infusion adopter modules of a course in Introduction to Art as taught by Dr. Scott Betz. The Introduction to Art course is offered in the Art department once a year in the Fall at Winston-Salem State University. This course is primarily intended for art majors or those who have an interest in art.

This lecture course will help the student to build a foundation for the individual experience and enjoyment of art. It presents art theory, practice, and history. It is designed to enhance awareness and appreciation of the visual arts. 
# Learning Outcomes
* Students will be able to see opportunities in the areas of arts careers that include science and new technologies that add worth to the field of the arts.
* Students will be able to perform, interpret and report the findings of selected statistical analyses such as descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, regression analyses and epidemiologic tables using public health and biomedical data.


# Data Science Infusion
The primary focus of this reposity concerns only the portion of the course where the data science infusion modules were implemented as part of the CADS adopter program. These modules are classified into four broad areas:

* Introduction to SAS Programming
* Hypothesis Testing
* Categorical Data Analysis
* Correlation and Regression
