# CSC1105-Computer-Science-Colloquium-Data-Science-Module
This is a repository containing the material regarding data science modules implemented as a part of Winston-Salem State University's [Center for Applied Data Science (CADS)](https://www.wssu.edu/academics/colleges-and-departments/college-of-arts-sciences-business-education/center-for-applied-data-science/index.html) Faculty Adopter program. The Faculty Adopter Program is designed to support enthusiastic faculty who are willing to infuse data science into their courses across various disciplines and are capable of quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the impact of their interventions. 

# Computer Science Colloquium
This respository contains the data science infusion adopter modules of the Computer Science Colloquium course taught by Dr. Munene Kanampiu. The Computer Science Colloquium course is offered in the Computer Science department once a year at Winston-Salem State University. The students who enroll in this course are majoring in Computer Science, usually those who are first-years.

The focus of this course involves broadening studentâ€™s general knowledge of computing fields and computer ethics, as well as developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills using current technologies and computing tools. 

# Learning Outcomes
* Students will be introduced to the emerging field of data science and analytics in a guided, step-by-step, experiential modular methodology, especially by way of cloud computing.
* Students will have the knowledge and skill in data science for workshops, symposiums, and upper level courses.

# Data Science Infusion
The primary focus of this repository concerns only the portion of the course where the data science infusion modules were implemented as part of the CADS adopter program. These modules are classified into two broad areas:
* Module 1: Introduction to Data Science and Applications
* Module 2: Data Acquisition, Cleaning, Manipulation and Visualization
